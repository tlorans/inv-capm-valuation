title: "Why Rebuild Valuation?"
---

**Thesis.** Valuation is capital allocation under uncertainty. Traditional DCF
treats **cash flows** and the **discount rate** as exogenous inputs. The Investment
CAPM (production-based asset pricing) derives both from the **firmâ€™s optimal
investment policy** under technology and adjustment costs.

**What this book does.**

1. Replace ad-hoc DCF components with a structural production model.
2. Show that expected returns (risk premia) are tied to **investment** and **profitability**.
3. Build practical workflows for investors and risk managers.
