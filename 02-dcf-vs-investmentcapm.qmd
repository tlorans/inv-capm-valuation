title: "DCF vs. Investment CAPM"
---

### The two identities

**Traditional DCF**
$$
V_0=\sum_{t\ge1}\frac{E[CF_t]}{(1+r)^t}
$$

Cash flows and \(r\) are *assumptions*.

**Investment CAPM (structural valuation)**
$$
V_0=E_0\sum_{t\ge1}\frac{\pi(K_t,I_t^*)-\Phi(I_t^*,K_t)}{\prod_{s=1}^t (1+R_s)}
$$

where \(I_t^*\) solves the firm’s production problem and \(R_s\) follows from the
pricing condition (Euler equation).

### The firm’s problem (preview)
$$
\max_{\{I_t\}} E_0 \sum_{t\ge0} \frac{\pi(K_t,I_t) - \Phi(I_t,K_t)}{\prod_{s=1}^t(1+R_s)}
\quad \text{s.t. } K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_t+I_t
$$

- \(\pi(K,I)\): operating profits from capital and investment.
- \(\Phi(I,K)\): convex adjustment costs (irreversibility, ramp-up frictions).
- Decision variable: **investment**.

### What changes for practitioners?

| Topic | DCF (reduced-form) | Investment CAPM (structural) |
|---|---|---|
| Cash flows | projected line-by-line | implied by \( \pi-\Phi \) at \(I_t^*\) |
| Discount rate | chosen (CAPM/WACC) | implied by Euler condition |
| Growth | plug-in \(g\) | outcome of optimal policy |
| Risk | beta heuristics | tied to investment opportunities |

**Investor rule.** You can still produce a **valuation**, but now it’s internally
consistent with optimal investment and risk.
