    "text": "Thesis. Valuation is capital allocation under uncertainty. Traditional DCF treats cash flows and the discount rate as exogenous inputs. The Investment CAPM (production-based asset pricing) derives both from the firm’s optimal investment policy under technology and adjustment costs.\nWhat this book does.\n\nReplace ad-hoc DCF components with a structural production model.\nShow that expected returns (risk premia) are tied to investment and profitability.\nBuild practical workflows for investors and risk managers.",
